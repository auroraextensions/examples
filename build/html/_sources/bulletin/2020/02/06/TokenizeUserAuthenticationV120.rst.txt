packed full of improvements and new features, including support for multi-factor
authentication, which we discuss at length in `MFA`_.

^^^^^^^^^^

You will have the option to enable/disable MFA for administrators and customers.
When enabled, administrators/customers will be required to create a numeric PIN
when they register their accounts, and will provide their PIN each time they log
in to their account.
