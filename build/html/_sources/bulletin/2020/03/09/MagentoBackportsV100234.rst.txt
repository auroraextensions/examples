Summary
-------

Magento Backports is our community effort to provide Magento classes and interfaces from newly
released versions for use in older versions of Magento. This allows an extension developer to
leverage newer Magento features without having to stress quite as much about issues around
upgrades and version compatibility.

Versioning for Magento Backports follows our metapackage versioning conventions and corresponds
to the backported version of Magento. For example, Magento Backports v100.2.3.4 is the version
providing support for Magento v2.3.4.

Magento Backports v100.2.3.4 is now available on GitHub.
